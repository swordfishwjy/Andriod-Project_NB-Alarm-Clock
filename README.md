** “NB Alarm Clock” ** aims at waking people up in the morning. It’s an alarm clock, only much better. -------by NB Alarm Clock Group

In most of the cases, setting an alarm clock means nothing to those who love sleeping more than anything else. Most of the alarm clocks in the market are too easy to be turned off. By simply unlocking the screen or exiting the alarm application, one can go back to sleep in seconds. What’s more, normally used alarm clocks have no attraction to users but simply an alarm function. The above two flaws motivate us to develop a better application, which can definitely wake people up and turn waking up in the morning into a more interesting and happy moment of the day.

### NB Alarm Clock
“NB Alarm Clock helps you keep fit.” -------by NB Alarm Clock Group
We implemented six modes to wake people up.
1. Crazy Jump
2. Take a Picture
3. Draw with Fingers
4. Crazy Shake
5. Draw in the Air
6. Scream

** Functions that against cheating: **
Back button of the device is disabled so that there is no way back. App can restart itself and it cannot be killed unless user finishes his task. Volume of the alarm cannot be adjusted and will increase if user tries to decrease it.

#### Crazy Jump
Crazy Jump pushes people to get out of bed and jump. Only if users jump very hard and satisfy the standard for three times will the alarm stop. It sounds easy, however, very hard to accomplish. 

#### Take a Picture
In this mode users will be asked to take a picture of an object before setting up time. When the alarm starts, users will be asked to take another picture of the same object the night before. A half transparent picture will be shown on the preview while camera is on, which works as a hint to remind user what to catch and in what position should he hold the phone. Only if the two photos by comparison have a similarity over 90% will the alarm stop.
 
#### Draw with Fingers

Draw with fingers mode present users a half transparent picture on which lays a figure with a red point marking start point. Users need to draw on the figure from start point to end point. When finish, only if the two figures (original one and the one user draws) by comparison reach 90% of similarity will the alarm stop.

#### Crazy Shake
Just as the name indicates, users need to hold their phones tight and shake phones for 10 times to satisfy the requirement. A count down counter will show up on the screen to remind users how far to go.

#### Draw in the Air
In this mode users need to hold their phones and draw a triangle in the air for three times. An arrow will show up on one of the edge of the triangle on screen to lead users move their arms in the right direction. One interesting aspect of this mode is that the geographic orientation of users when they invoke this mode does matters. It cannot be changed; otherwise no right action will be considered taken.
